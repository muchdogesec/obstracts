#
name: Create and publish the Public Docker image for Obstracts Web Staging
description: This workflow builds a Docker image and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. It uses secrets in the `obstracts_staging` environment and therefore keeps the visibility as private for the image.

# Configures this workflow to run every time a change is pushed to the branch called `release`.
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

# Defines two custom environment variables for the workflow. These are used for the Container registry domain, and a name for the Docker image that this workflow builds.
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}_staging
